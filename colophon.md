I constructed this website from little bits of code I found. I use [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) to generate the pages from Markdown. I use [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to host. 

If you are interested in creating your own website I have been inspired by [Tufte CSS](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/), [Edwin Wenink](https://www.edwinwenink.xyz/), and [Gwern](https://www.gwern.net/index).
