# My Linux Journey

I started using Linux as a novelty. 
As the majority people do, I started with Ubuntu, I think it was 2016. 
I learned of Ubuntu in middle school and installed it in a virtual machine at home to mess around with
I didn't understand how virtual machines worked or even what Linux really was, but I enjoyed the oddity of having an operating system on top of Windows. 
I didn't use my Ubuntu install for anything wonderfully so it didn't last one.

Fueled by the novelty of Linux, I started to install it other places.
I installed Elementary OS to an old laptop.
This laptop turned out have to have a motherboard issue, making it unusable.
Soon, I learned that I could bring Linux other places.
Using [Pen Drive Linux's](https://www.pendrivelinux.com/universal-usb-installer-easy-as-1-2-3/) installer I created a bootable Damn Small Linux USB drive.
The magic of this drive was that it didn't need to be booted.
I later (much later) learned that this was due to Qemu.
I loading my  magic drive on a school computer and showed people. No one cared of course. I also couldn't show it to teachers due to the window saying "Damn". 
Without anything useful to do with my Linux knowledge, I left. 
One must remember that I was roughly  in the 7th or 8th grade so I could leave things quickly. 

At this time the only programming I had done was simple Python. 
I did not make any large projects, and I didn't save much of anything.
The problem with my Python knowledge was that it was all syntax. 
I did not understand any computer science concepts. 
However, I was still ahead of the rest of peers.

Starting in late 2019, I reentered the world of Linux. 
This time was different, it was too get ahead in college.
I [strongly believe](articles/findAPath) that one should try subjects before devoting four or more years to it in university.
Knowing that I would like to program in the future, I looked into it more intensely. 
I have this deep dislike for heavy web design, so I was wary of high-level programming.
I had taken two computer science courses at school (regular and Advanced Placement Computer Science Principles) so I knew really basic concepts.
I decided to take CS50.
Learning C was probably thing I could have done.
I fell in love.

What goes well with C? 
Unix.
I dual booted Ubuntu and set it up.
This time I started to rice it.
In my search for Gnome Tweaks, I learned the most important about using Linux as a desktop user. 
**Pick a distribution based on the package management, not the looks.**
I also learned about windows managers.
Around this time I was starting to get YouTube recommendations about Arch Linux.
To be honest, the strong community was attractive.
So I installed Manjaro with KDE Plasma.
I liked it at the time, but I would later know this was not the endgame.

I started to install vanilla Arch on a virtual machine. I tried to dual boot it, but it wouldn't boot.
I looked for Manjaro alternatives, so I installed Arco Linux.
Arco Linux's website is weird and hard to follow.
However, Arch's wiki is one of the best in the world.
After a week on Arco, I started to use it more than Windows.

Arco allowed me to try different window managers with ease.
I tried a lot, but kept using Plasma. 
After three months of daily use, I had a very customized system.
The only issue was that my dotfiles were modified Arco defaults, with a bunch of stuff I didn't use.
So I decided to start from scratch.
It took weeks.
I slowly made of software I liked or needed.
I also started on dwm config.

My endgame started to form. I installed Artix Linux. 
I had briefly used OpenRC in Alpine Linux (booted on a USB).
This time I knew GRUB better, so I could get it to boot.
Starting with a blank slate was freely.
Getting used to dwm was fun, and I see no reason to leave.
Am I finished?
Of course not.
I love the Arch-based package environment (AUR is great).
And I love the Arch wiki.
The only two logical steps is to reject everything and install Debian or go farther and install Gentoo.
I don't know. 
Maybe I will try Linux From Scratch. Anyways, thank you for reading my rambling.
